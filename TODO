- labor
  - map labor to demand
  - track how much money labor has

- additional commodities
  - button for producing additional types of commodities
  - make this growth necessary

- unrest counter
  - what happens when demand isn't met
  - when labor doesn't have enough money
  - when wages can't be paid
  - lose the game when unrest hits 100%
  - reduce productivity based on unrest

- how to indicate what is causing unrest/where the bottlenecks are
  - breakdown of what is contributing to unrest
  - ticker item whenever unrest is being generated?

- ticks on a timer
- costs for production?
